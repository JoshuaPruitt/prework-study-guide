          <li>The "checkout -b" command lets us create a new branch in the project. Ex: git checkout -b branch-name</li>
          <li>When changes to the project are made "add" can be used to stage the files. You can add specific files or all files with -A. Ex: git add -A</li>
          <li>To commit the changes "commit" will add the changes to the file online. -m can be used to add a message with this change. Ex: git commit -m "added code"</li>
          <li>To check that a branch is up to date you can use "pull origin branch". Its good practice to check that things are up to date before opening a pull request. Ex: git pull origin main</li>
