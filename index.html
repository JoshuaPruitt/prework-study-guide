        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
         
          <li>The h1-h6 tag can be used to create header text onto your page.</li>
          <li>!-- is used to create notes on your code.</li>
          <li>The ul tag creates an "unordered list" you can then fill this space with text using the li tag.</li>
          <li>Img is used to add images to the page. You use src to import the image and use width and height to change its size on the page </li>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Selectors are is the first component before any piece of code. Common selectors are *, img, ect. These determine what part of the page you are affecting </li>
          <li>A CSS rule is started with a selector then brackets are used to contain the declarations. The declarations is the code thats changes the element.</li>
          <li>The * selector effects the entire page. The img selector effects all images on a page.</li>
          <li>Margins are the space around the elements in a page.</li>
          <li>Padding is the space around an element. Changing this effects how much space between the margin and the elements.</li>
          <li>To add CSS code from a file to the html page you use the link tag in the head section. rel spefifies the relation between the CSS file and the html file. href specifies the location of the css file.</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="git-section">
        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The "git status" command checks what branch we are currently on. </li>
          <li>"Checkout" lets us switch branches. Ex: git checkout main.</li>
          <li>The "checkout -b" command lets us create a new branch in the project. Ex: git checkout -b branch-name</li>
          <li>When changes to the project are made "add" can be used to stage the files. You can add specific files or all files with -A. Ex: git add -A</li>
          <li>To commit the changes "commit" will add the changes to the file online. -m can be used to add a message with this change. Ex: git commit -m "added code"</li>
          <li>To check that a branch is up to date you can use "pull origin branch". Its good practice to check that things are up to date before opening a pull request. Ex: git pull origin main</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li> A variable is a container that lets us hold a value.</li>
          <li>An Array is a single variable that is used to hold a bunch of different values. Ex: const shapes = ["square", "triangle", "circle"]</li>
          <li>You can call specific parts of the array by adressing its number. A number is assigned to each value depending on order. Ex: shapes[0] Outcome: Square</li>
          <li>An if statement is a conditional. Using an if statment lets you recieve different outcomes depending on if a variable passes or doesnt pass and if statement.</li>
          <li>else if is a supporting statement used in an if statement. This widens the scope of the if statment and gives you more outcomes.</li>
          <li>let is a way to declare variables in javascript. Ex: let x = 1, this declares x as a variable and assigns it the value of 1. Let can be reasigned if needed.</li>
          <li>const is another way to declare a variable. A const or Constant makes a value consitant, meaning that this value cannot be changed once assigned.</li>
